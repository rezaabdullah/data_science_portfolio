# Point-Distance
### Project Motivation
The objective of the project is to find distance between two points in Geodesic place or 2D euclidean space.

### Project Objective
The objective of the project is to create a python package and upload it to PyPI.

### Problem Statement
1. Determine distance between two points in geodesic plane, specifically distance between two points on earth.
2. Determine distance between two points in euclidean space, specifically 2-D space.
