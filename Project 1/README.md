# Project 1: Writing a Data Science Blog Post

### Motivation
In this project, we will be exploring how data science can optimize Out-of-Home (OOH) marketing and advertising. For years. OOH has been relying mostly on census data and traffic counts which are collected periodically (every quarter or every six months). However, consumers' movement behavior can vary widely in three months or six months. Therefore, it is necessary to take more dynamic approach. With abundance of user data, it is easy to obtain Geodata from various devices and this data can help us to make better OOH marketing decisions more frequently.

### Problem Statement
While various digital marketing tools make it easier to track online behavior, consumers' offline behavior is hard to collect and even harder to draw insights from. However, abundance of geospatial data from mobile devices can help us determining consumers' offline behavior. The insights from the analysis can help brands to strategize their marketing plan for Out-of-Home (OOH) marketing and advertising. In this project we are trying to analyze data for billboards and the questions we're trying to answer are listed below:
1. Where should brand owner or media buyer display their content to maximize the number of audiences?
2. Is there any correlation among hour, number of POIs (Point of Interest), number of roads and number of audiences?
3. Where should media owners build their next billboard?

### Description of Files
* project_1_location_intelligence.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for python scripts
* kl_billboard.csv: Dataset for the analysis
* Images of scatter plot maps (.png files)

### Required Libraries
1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): Data manipulation and analysis
2. [Numpy](https://numpy.org): Data manipulation and analysis
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org): Data visualization
4. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org): Data visualization

### Summary of the Analysis
The detailed discussion about the business implication of the project has been shared on [Medium](https://medium.com/@abdullahreza/how-can-you-leverage-data-in-ooh-marketing-advertising-9220f350ce61). Based on the analysis, Geodata can answer some of the problems faced by OOH merketers and media owners.

* Geodata can help us to identify the highperforming billboards. In fact, less than 1% of all the billboards in Kuala Lumpur attract more than 70,000 audiences.
* Higher number of POIs in the vicinity of the Billboards draw more audiences.
* Geodata can also help us in selecting the locations for building the next billboards by identifying the areas that attracts higher number of audiences.
