    "In this project we will explore how geospatial data can optimize OOH marketing & advertising.\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Overlay consumers' mobile device data with other data sources to answer following three questions:\n",
    "1. Which billboards have the highest potential reach i.e. number of unique audiences?\n",
    "2. When (time of the day) are the audiences most likely to see the advertisement?\n",
    "3. Where should I build my next billboard?\n",

    "**Mobile Device Data:** Consumers' data that has following features:\n",
    "1. advertising_id\n",

    "3. longitude\n",
    "4. unix_timestamp\n",
    "5. place_name\n",

    "**Note:** *Provided sample file has been preprocessed to some extent. It excludes place_name, brand_name and category_name.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Billboard Locations:** It has following features:\n",
    "1. billboard_object_id\n",
    "5. latitude\n",
    "6. longitude\n",
    "7. type\n",
    "\n",
    "**District Map:** Shapefile of the map of the city. To learn more about shapefile, refer [here](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/shapefiles/what-is-a-shapefile.htm#:~:text=A%20shapefile%20is%20a%20simple,%2C%20or%20polygons%20(areas))."
